### Project Overview
For our project, we used the **Yelp Fusion API** to create informative and interactive data visualizations. Our group finds Yelp to be immensely helpful, so we strived to explore ways to communicate different pieces of information that the app offers.

The user is able to enter a location, and the different tabs of the **“Widgets”** page will display relevant information for that location. Try it out for yourself!

The questions that guided our project are:
  - *What are the top-rated restaurants in my area?*
  - *Can you recommend me a restaurant in my area?*
  - *What are the distributions for restaurant types and prices near me?*

We answered these questions through four visualizations in our “Widgets” panel.

### About the Dataset
