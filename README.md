# Info 201 Final Project

### Project Overview
For our project, we used the **Yelp Fusion API** to create informative and interactive data visualizations. Our group finds Yelp to be immensely helpful, so we strived to explore ways to communicate different pieces of information that the app offers.

The app can be found on the Shiny server __[here](https://jamiekiok.shinyapps.io/INFO201FinalProject/)__!

The questions that guided our project are:
  - *What are the top-rated restaurants in my area?*
  - *Can you recommend me a restaurant in my area?*
  - *What are the distributions for restaurant types and prices near me?*

### About the Dataset
Our data came from [the Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/faq), which allows access to updated and comprehensive information and reviews about millions of businesses around the world.
